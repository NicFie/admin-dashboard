This is the final project from the Intermediate HTML and CSS on The Odin Project. I will be building a full dashboard design, using CSS Grid. 
The dashboard will be part of CM staff (a website specifically for orchestras and adult players), which I may use in real life in the future. 
I will use a variety of intermediate grid techniques. For now, it will just be for desktops.
